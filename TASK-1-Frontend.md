# Task Details
Please build a Dummy Dashboard similar to below Layout image. This task is more frontend task to test your skills on HTML, CSS(or Tailwind CSS Lib), Javascript, DHTML and 
Svelte.

This task is more about "Svelte" frontend.

 But to get the work done you require below items:
 
 - [Common General Dev Setup/Tools and Url's](README.md)

 - Required - Git, Visual Studio Code IDE(has inbuild git), installation instructions are available at [Frontend Svelte Installation](docs/README.Frontend.Svelte.md) file.
 
 - Optional - Incase you want to integrate Backend then install Composer(Laravel Package Manager), Laravel(PHP Framework),XAMPP setup and installation instructions are available at [Backend Installation](docs/README.Backend.md) file.

Below is the Dashboard that you need to build using Svelte.

1. Extreme Left hand side the blue column will be having Different Product option(circles or image) for selection.
2. Once you click on Option(circle or image) then it will open foldable Column(Grey/Black color Menu) and it will be having further links to choose from. Grey/Blue lines in foldable menu are just links.
3. Center page can have any Frame to have simple text to data coming from different sources and usually the main body part.
4. Top row contains various URLS. Like Extreme left circle is User Profile Icon and once you select then user should get logout, Profile Details edit options.
5. Just below top row there is another row having various filters like Pagination to move in between pages etc.
6. Bottom Row will be having Cancel and Save button.

HINT: Reference to Metronics Layout template will give you some hint about the layout names.[Marketting Automation Layout Template](https://preview.keenthemes.com/metronic8/demo31/index.html) resembles the layout that we are expecting here with some minor differences so you can use reference to complete your task.

Incase, you are new to Backend, Frontend, Full Stack or unclear about how each component will stitch then below architecture diagram will help you to understand about the place in the Web interface where your Task work fit in big picture of the project. So we want you to code Frontend components colored in Orange. You can ignore svelte-plugin backend part as of now.
